## 1. Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have you have node installed
```
npm i node
```

## 2. Clone Repository

Clone the repository to local machine [Clone Repository].
```
git clone https://github.com/tasamai/Netflix-Clone.git
```

## 3. Running Project

To run the project on your local machine run the following code in your terminal

### `npm start`

The app will run in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

This project is deployed on firebase. To do so:
#### 1. Login/Sign-up to firebase
#### 2. Go to the firebase console
#### 3. Create a new project
#### 4. Check if firebase tools is installed
#### 5. If not installed, use the command below (use sudo if necessary):
      ### `npm install -g firebase-tools`
#### 6. Login to firebase in your command line:
      ### `firebase login`
#### 7. Initialise Firebse:
      ### `firebase init`
#### 8. Build your project:
      ### `npm run build`
#### 9. Finally, deploy your project:
       ### `firebase deploy`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
